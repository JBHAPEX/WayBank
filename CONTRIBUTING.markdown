# Contributing to WayPool Delta Neutral Algorithm

Thank you for your interest in contributing to WayPool! We’re building an open-source DeFi project to minimize impermanent loss in concentrated liquidity pools, and we welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and DeFi enthusiasts.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the “Fork” button on the [WayPool repository](https://github.com/your-username/waypool-delta-neutral) to create a copy in your GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine (`git clone https://github.com/your-username/waypool-delta-neutral.git`).
3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
4. **Make Changes**: Implement your feature, bug fix, or documentation improvement.
5. **Commit Changes**: Commit with a clear message (`git commit -m 'Add feature X'`).
6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your branch to your GitHub fork (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
7. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and open a pull request (PR) from your branch. Describe your changes in detail.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Code Style**: Follow standard conventions for any code contributions:
  - Solidity: Use the [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html).
  - Python: Adhere to [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/).
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation (e.g., README, whitepaper) if your changes affect usage or functionality.
- **Testing**: Ensure your changes include tests (e.g., unit tests for smart contracts) and do not break existing functionality.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., “Add IL calculation function to smart contract”).
- **Issue Tracking**: Reference related issues in your PR (e.g., “Fixes #12”).

## Areas for Contribution
- **Algorithm Development**: Enhance the delta-neutral algorithm (e.g., optimize calculations, add support for new AMMs).
- **Smart Contracts**: Develop or audit Solidity contracts for pool interactions.
- **Simulations**: Create Python scripts to simulate IL hedging scenarios.
- **Documentation**: Improve the whitepaper, README, or add tutorials.
- **Testing**: Write tests for algorithm accuracy or smart contract security.

## Requirements
- Familiarity with DeFi concepts (AMMs, impermanent loss, liquidity pools).
- Experience with blockchain development (Solidity, Hardhat, Truffle) or Python for simulations is a plus.
- Basic Git and GitHub knowledge.
