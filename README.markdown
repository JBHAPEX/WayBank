# WayPool Delta Neutral Algorithm

![WayPool Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150) <!-- Replace with your logo if available -->

## Overview
WayPool is an open-source DeFi project that introduces a delta-neutral algorithm to minimize impermanent loss in concentrated liquidity pools, such as Uniswap V4. By dynamically balancing cryptocurrencies and implementing leveraged short positions, our algorithm maximizes capital efficiency and protects liquidity providers from price volatility.

## Whitepaper
The whitepaper, ["Calculation of Capital Percentage to Hedge Losses in Concentrated Liquidity Pools"](WayPool_Delta_Neutral_Whitepaper.pdf), provides:
- A mathematical formula to calculate the capital needed for hedging impermanent loss.
- A practical example using ETH/USDC with 5x leverage.
- Key considerations for DeFi applications.
